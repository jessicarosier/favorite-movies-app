# favorite-movies-app

## Overview
This is a simple web app that allows users to search for movies and add them to a list of favorites. The app uses the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org//) to search for movies and retrieve movie data. The app uses a local JSON database to store the list of favorite movies.

This was a pair programming development project completed in 1 week.
