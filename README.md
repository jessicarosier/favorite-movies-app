# favorite-movies-app

## Overview

This web app allows users to search for movies and add them to a list of favorites. The app uses
the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org//) to search for movies and retrieve movie data as well as a local JSON
database to store the list of favorite movies.

This was a pair programming development project completed in 1 week.
